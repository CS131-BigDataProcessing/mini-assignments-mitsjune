	airlines: 
		"Alaska"
		"American"
		"Delta"
		"Jet Blue"
		"Southwest"
		"United"
		"airline"

	command: awk -F, '{print $4}' airline_stats.csv | sort -u


2. Which airlines have: (Include your awk command for part a and b)
  a. Has a carrier delay greater than 10 and print airline names (alphabetically. Hint* pipe input into sort)

	airlines: 
		"Alaska"
		"American"
		"Delta"
		"Jet Blue"
		"Southwest"
		"United"

	command: awk -F, '$1 > 10 {print $4}' airline_stats.csv | sort -u


  b. Has a carrier delay greater than a certain threshold of 15? Use -v to pass in a value that is set to 'Threshold = 15'  

	airlines: 
		"Alaska"
		"American"
		"Delta"
		"Jet Blue"
		"Southwest"
		"United"

	command: awk -F, -v Threshold=15 '$1 > Threshold {print $4}' airline_stats.csv | sort -u
